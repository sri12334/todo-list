### Development Strategy

1. **Setup**: Set up the project structure with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
2. **HTML**: Create the basic layout structure with appropriate elements for input field, buttons, and todo list.
3. **CSS**: Style the components to achieve the desired visual appearance and layout.
4. **JavaScript**: Implement functionality to add new todos, mark todos as completed, delete todos, and persist data using local storage.
5. **Testing**: Test the application thoroughly to ensure all features work as expected and handle edge cases appropriately.
